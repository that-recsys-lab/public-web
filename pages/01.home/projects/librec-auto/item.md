#### Information

In this project, we are developing a Python wrapper for the LibRec recommendation systems platform. (Learn more at [librec.net](librec.net)) The wrapper makes it easier for researchers to experiment with a variety of algorithms and configuration options. 

The tool was presented as a demo at the 2018 ACM Recommender Systems conference. [See associated paper.](../../pubs/2018_recsys_librec/)
