# Tutorial
## Experimentation with fairness-aware recommendation using librec-auto

The field of machine learning fairness has developed some
well-understood metrics, methodologies, and data sets for
experimenting with and developing classification algorithms
with an eye to their fairness properties. However, equivalent
research is lacking in the area of personalized recommender
systems, even though such systems are crucial components
of the applications through which millions of individuals
daily access news, shopping, social connections, and employment opportunities. This 180-minute hands-on tutorial
will introduce participants to concepts in fairness-aware
recommendation (as a distinct from classification-oriented
systems) and metrics and methodologies in evaluating recommendation fairness. The tutorial will introduce LibRec, a
well-developed platform for recommender systems evaluation, and fairness-aware extensions to it. Participants will
also gain hands-on experience with conducting fairness-aware recommendation experiments with LibRec using the
librec-auto scripting platform, and learn the steps required
to configure their own experiments, incorporate their own
data sets, and design their own algorithms and metrics.


## Tutorial plan

- Introduction to recommender systems and fairness-aware recommendation.
- Installation and configuration of LibRec and librec-auto.
- Configuring and running sample recommendation experiments.
- Consumer and provider fairness. Fairness metrics for recommendation.
- Fairness-aware recommendation algorithms.
- Implementing a fairness-aware re-ranker.
- Visualizing experimental results.
- Questions and individual exploration.

## Presenters

- <b>Professor Robin Burke</b> is Professor and Chair of the
Department of Information Science at the University
of Colorado, Boulder. He has been conducting recommender systems research since the mid-1990s and his
current research focused on fairness in recommendation, including current support from the National
Science Foundation in this area. Professor Burke has
prior experience in conference tutorials to a wide variety of audiences including “Robust Recommendation”
(RecSys 2008), “Mining Diverse Texts for Location and
Sentiment” with John Shanahan and Ana Lucic (Digital
Humanities and Computer Science 2017), and “Fairness
and Discrimination in Recommendation and Retrieval”
with Michael Ekstrand and Fernando Diaz (RecSys
2019). He has led the librec-auto project since its
inception.

- <b>Masoud Mansoury</b> is a PhD student at the Eindhoven
University of Technology under the direction of Mykola
Pechenizkiy. His research interests include fairness-aware recommender systems, machine learning, and social network analysis. Masoud has been one of the core contributors to the librec-auto project and presented on the
project, most recently at the 1st Interdisciplinary Workshop on Algorithm Selection and Meta-Learning in
Information Retrieval (AMIR 2019).

## Contributors
- <b>Nasim Sonboli</b> is a PhD student in the Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and a member of That Recommender Systems Lab. She’s working on the fairness, accountability and transparency of recommendation algorithms and has several publications in ACM FAT* Conference and ACM Recommender Systems Conference. She is one of the core contributors to the librec-auto and LibRec projects, especially in the area of fairness-aware metrics and algorithms.

## Target audience

The aim of this tutorial is to support researchers who
have an interest in fairness and recommendation by offering:
- An introduction to the unique and complex aspects of
fairness in the recommender systems context,
- An introduction to methodologies for off-line recommender systems evaluation,
- Hands-on experience designing and configuring fairness-aware recommender systems experiments using a state-of-the-art tool.

Participants will leave the tutorial with the ability to
conduct fairness-aware recommendation experiments on
their own data sets, and for the more technically-inclined,
with the foundations necessary to conduct experimental
research in fairness-aware recommendation including implementing and evaluating fairness-aware recommendation
algorithms and creating new fairness metrics for such experiments.

## Instructions for participants

For performing sample experiments during the tutorial session, participants will need to have:
- a machine running Linux, MacOS, or Windows
- ability to run Java libraries (version >= 1.8)
- Anaconda with Python version >= 3.6
- ability to install new Python libraries 
- a text editor
