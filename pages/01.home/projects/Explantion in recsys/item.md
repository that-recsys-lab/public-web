#### Description
In this project, we aim to define new types of explanations in recommender systems that have been rarely explored in this field. 
Since the ranking process in recommender systems is often not transparent, users may struggle to understand how rankings are derived. Research suggests that providing explanations for rankings enhances user understanding of system operations and improves trust. A key goal of this project is to highlight a type of explanation that has not received much attention in the recommender systems community—contrastive explanation—where comparisons between alternatives help users understand why one option was chosen over another.

We examine explanations by considering three key aspects:

Audience: To whom is the explanation being delivered? Recommender systems operate in multistakeholder environments, where explanations must be tailored to different stakeholder audiences. The three primary stakeholders in any recommender system are consumers, providers, and the system itself.

Scope: Explanations vary in form depending on whether they address recommendations for individual items or explain the overall behavior of the recommender system over time or across a set of items.

Source: The next aspect of the scope for explanations is the question of the source of the explanation.

By addressing these dimensions, our project aims to advance the understanding and development of effective explanations in recommender systems.
