#### Abstract

When evaluating recommender systems for their fairness to users, it
may be necessary to make use of demographic attributes, which are
personally sensitive and usually excluded from publicly-available
data sets. In addition, these attributes are fixed and therefore it
is not possible to experiment with different distributions using
the same data. In this paper, we describe the Frequency-Linked
Attribute Generation (FLAG) algorithm, and show its applicability
for assigning synthetic demographic attributes to recommendation
data sets.
