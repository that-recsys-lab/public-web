### Research

I conduct research mostly in recommender systems and personalization, more generally. Recently, I have been interested in two closely-related topics:

- **Multistakeholder recommendation**, which refers to a recommendation application in which parties other than just the end user need to be considered in computing recommendation outcomes. If that sounds a bit shady, it is perhaps because we are accustomed to think of recommender systems as reflecting only user interests and to do otherwise seems to undermine the whole enterprise. However, there are many situations (for example, health, education, etc.) where the system may have its own ethically-sound reasons for preferring certain recommendations over others. 
- **Fairness-aware recommendation** is a sub-class of multistakeholder recommendation in which the system has a concern for delivering results that meet some criterion of fairness. That criterion may exist relative to the users consuming recommendations _C-Fairness_ or relative to the providers of items being recommended _P-Fairness_ or both. 

I am also interested in practical problems of conducting recommender systems research and achieving replicable results. 

### Teaching

Spring 2019: INFO 4871/5871:  	

This is a research seminar that will explore the space of personalized information access applications known as recommender systems. This class will introduce students to a range of approaches for building recommender systems including collaborative, content-based, knowledge-based,and hybrid methods. Students will also explore a variety of applications for recommendation including consumer products, music, social media, and online advertising. The course will also examine controversies surrounding recommendation, including Pariser’s “filter bubble”, the deployment of personalization as a tool for electoral manipulation, and questions of algorithmic bias.
