#### Description

[POPROX](../poprox) is community research infrastructure for performing recommender systems experiments with live users. You can read more about the project [here](http://poprox.ai). POPROX.edu aims to develop novel high school media literacy curricula integrated with hands-on experience in the algorithmic mediation of news supported by the POPROX codebase. We are still in the process of launching this project but the plan is to create a new instance of the POPROX project -- named POPROX.edu -- aimed at student subscribers. 

POPROX delivers daily personalized newsletters drawn from the Associated Press; at the same time, it supports researchers in studying news recommendation "in the wild" with a robust capability to integrate experimental algorithms for A/B testing  and data gathering. POPROX.edu would adapt the capabilities for POPROX to make it a tool to support education. This version of the system will not emphasize algorithmic experimentation but instead support students and teachers with hands-on learning in algorithmic mediation. POPROX.edu will contain youth-specific news sources including the student newspaper at the high school the students attend. The usefulness, appropriateness and suitability of newsletter content will be ascertained through student surveys and in collaboration with teachers.
