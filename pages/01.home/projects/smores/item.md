#### Description

The **SMROES** project is designed to simulate [*"The Friendly Algorithm Store"*](https://publicinfrastructure.org/2023/03/29/the-three-legged-stool/), an ecosystem where users can choose between multiple recommendation algorithms developed by various third-party entities. This project seeks to explore the implications, benefits, and limitations of such a decentralized structure on three key stakeholders: **consumers, content providers, and platforms**.

By moving away from the traditional monolithic recommender system model—where a single platform dictates recommendation logic—this approach examines how distributing algorithmic control can impact stakeholder utility, competition, and innovation. It provides an experimental framework to assess *whether algorithmic plurality leads to improved user experiences, increased fairness for niche providers, and a more balanced distribution of exposure and profit across the ecosystem*.

Moreover, SMROES fosters a space for **creative algorithmic design**, allowing third-party developers to introduce novel recommendation strategies tailored to different user needs. By decentralizing recommendation power, this project contributes to the broader discourse on **algorithmic governance, transparency, and user agency** in digital ecosystems.
