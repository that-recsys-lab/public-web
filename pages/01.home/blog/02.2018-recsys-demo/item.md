Three of us (Aldo Ordonez-Gauger, Robin Burke, and Xavier Sepulveda) presented a poster and a demo of `librec-auto`, our automation tool for [LibRec ](http:///www.librec.net/)experiments. There was a lot of interest from the crowd and it was a great experience for the two students. We now have a long list of features that people want. We hope to have the alpha version up on our bitbucket repository sometime before the end of the year.
